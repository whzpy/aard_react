        What we know TRUMP LEAVES EGYPT: President Donald Trump has left Egypt
        after a whirlwind Middle East trip which included the signing of the
        peace deal to end the war in Gaza and addressing Israel's parliament,
        the Knesset. HOSTAGES TRANSFERRED: All 20 of the surviving hostages in
        Gaza have now been released. TO BE RELEASED: While the remains of other
        hostages were also expected to be transferred, the group representing
        families of abductees announced that "only four bodies" out of 28 held
        by Hamas would be heading back today. PALESTINIAN PRISONERS: Hamas had

        the group’s Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. WORLD LEADERS
